      "content": "If you are 55 and above and have made a voluntary housing refund, the refunded amount will be used to meet your cohort's Full Retirement Sum (FRS). The FRS helps to meet your retirement needs and ensure that you receive monthly payouts during your retirement. Any refunds that exceed your cohort’s FRS in your Retirement Account will remain in your CPF Ordinary and/or Special accounts. This means that your voluntary housing refund can help meet your retirement needs and provide a steady stream of income during your retirement years."
